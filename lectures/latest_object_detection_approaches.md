## DeepMask
Facebook AI Research (FAIR) 2014
- class agnostic segmentation:
- score of objectness
-
## Algorithm
- Images (224x224) will feed to VGG and obstain the feature extraction. (512x14x14)
- This will result in 56x56 mask that will be uploaded and binarized.



## SharpMask
Facebook AI Research  2016

## Algorithm
- Images (224x224) will feed to VGG or Resnet and obstain the feature extraction. (512x14x14)
- This will result in 56x56 mask that will be uploaded and binarized.
