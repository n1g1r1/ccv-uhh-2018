\chapter{Human Cognitive System}
\section{Neurons}
A neuron responds stronger to a given stimulus with a higher frequency of action potentials.

\section{Retina}

L-cones are read
M-cones are green
S-cones are blue

They collect informations and send them to the ganglion cells.

\subsection{Receiptive field}
Spatial area in visual field that has influence on the cell output.


\section{Edge detection}

\subsection{Gabor filters}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Can modal the human visual system at best.
    \item Mathematically a product of a gaussian and a sinusoid.
    \item The sinus-wave models the frequency of action potentials.
\end{itemize}
